# ⏱️ Stopwatch & Event Timer Web App

This project was developed as part of my Web Development and Designing internship. It's a dynamic, responsive web application featuring two key tools:

# ⏲️ Stopwatch

An easy-to-use stopwatch that allows users to:
- **Start** 
- **Stop** 
- **Reset** 
- **Lap** 

# 📅 Event Timer

A looping timer that tracks the time left until a recurring annual event. It includes a lap feature to record time checkpoints along the way. Once the target date arrives, it resets automatically.
