# Stopwatch & Event Timer Web App
This project was developed as part of my Web Development and Designing internship. It's a dynamic, responsive web application featuring two key tools:
# Stopwatch
An easy-to-use stopwatch that allow users to:
#Start 
#Stop
#Reset
#lap
# Event Timer
A looping timer that tracks the time left until a recurring annual event. It includes a lap feature to record time checkpoints along the way. Once the target date arrives, it resets automatically and starts tracking for the next year's eventâ€”no manual updates needed.
